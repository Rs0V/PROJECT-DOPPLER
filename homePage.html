                <span class="bold">Monstercat</span> is a Canadian independent electronic music record label based in Vancouver, 
                British Columbia. Founded in 2011 by Mike Darlington and Ari Paunonen, the label releases regular 
                compilation albums featuring music from various artists, beginning with the release of its first 
                compilation album, Monstercat 001 - Launch Week. Until the release of Monstercat 030 - Finale in 2017, 
                each compilation was given a name and depicted the story of the aforementioned mascot in the album cover. 
                This preceded a rebranding of the label, with a new series of albums titled Monstercat Uncaged. 
                In 2018, Monstercat introduced a new brand titled "Instinct". In 2021, Monstercat acquired electronic 
                label Silk Music to form a third brand titled "Monstercat Silk". The compilations ended the same year 
                with the release of Monstercat Uncaged Vol. 11. Monstercat has featured many notable artists, 
                including Pegboard Nerds, Vicetone, and Seven Lions. Monstercat has also released soundtrack albums for 
                various video games, including Fortnite, Rocket League and Beat Saber. The label is best known for the 
                2016 release of the song "Alone" by American DJ Marshmello, which reached Platinum status in the United States 
                and Canada in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The April Fool's Day release of "Crab Rave" by Irish music producer 
                Noisestorm became an internet meme for months after its release.

                <span class="bold">NoCopyrightSounds</span> is a British record label that releases royalty-free electronic dance music. 
                Starting as a YouTube channel, it reached 1 million paid downloads in 2017. NoCopyrightSounds was started 
                as a YouTube channel in 2011 by an "avid gamer" named Billy Woodford. The label was described by Forbes as 
                "a YouTube-first label that allows indie creators to use and even monetize its music freely as long as they 
                give due credit back to the content owners". In 2017, NoCopyrightSounds achieved a milestone of over a 
                million sales of digital downloads, despite releasing music for free. The label manager Daniel J. Lee said 
                "Similar to services with a freemium model, NCS provides both the option to enjoy music for free but at the same 
                time also enables fans to support the music across paid services", asserting that the label releases music for 
                free and also sells them. Woodford, about the milestone, stated, "I'm immensely proud to have reached 1 million 
                paid downloads, and believe this shows the growth and strength NCS has built over the years." He also commented that 
                "The demand for fresh original music from Creators is enormous and growing daily."

                <span class="bold">Spinnin' Records</span> is a Dutch electronic music record label founded in 1999 by Eelko van Kooten 
                and Roger de Graaf. In September 2017, Warner Music Group acquired Spinnin' Records for over $100 million. 
                Van Kooten is the son of former Dutch radio DJ and businessman Willem van Kooten, and initially worked in the 
                publishing business of his father. Together with Roger de Graaf, a former employee of the specialist dance 
                retailer Rhythm Import, van Kooten formed Spinnin' Records in 1999. In the beginning, they concentrated on the 
                pressing of vinyl for artists. Spinnin' Records hosts 25 active sub-labels alongside their main imprint; 
                the majority linked to a specific artist. The label provides A&R, management, publishing and (digital) 
                marketing for artists they have under contract. The label used to promote songs without naming the artists 
                in order to 'create a buzz'. Following the acquisition of Spinnin' by Warner Music Group, co-founder van 
                Kooten left the company while de Graaf became the CEO.
